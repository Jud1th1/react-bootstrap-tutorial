## My process
-   Prior to starting this tutorial, I watched a few refresher videos about the command line and then installed npm to the terminal
-   Following along with the video, I worked locally through my terminal and to create the React app and then open the folder created into VSCode
-   I installed react and bootstrap through the VSCode terminal before continuing the video to learn how to add some of the components
-   We began by adding a button from react-bootstrap into our JavaScript code and then importing Bootstrap CSS to style the button
-   We deleted the surrounding excess code and then continued to import components such as a form with email and password fields, a card with an image and a button, a breadcrumb, an alert, and rows with columns.
-   Each element was styled using the Bootstrap CSS we imported
-	Add that was how I created a simple web page with some Bootstrap components.
